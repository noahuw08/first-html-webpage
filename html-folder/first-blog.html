            How ChatGPT solved my Waterloo CS coding problem
        </h1>
        <h2>
            The problem goes like this:
        </h2>
        <h3> 
            Write a function <em>double-countdown</em> that consumes four natural numbers a, ai, b, and bi. 
            The function produces a list of natural numbers by counting down from a by multiples of ai and counting down from b by multiples of bi, 
            stopping at zero in both cases. The two countdowns are collected into a single list in descending order with no duplicates.
        </h3>

        <p>
            The function is written in Racket, with <em>Intermediate Student</em> language with <em>lambda</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            ChatGPT does exactly what I told it, and it even carefully explains the process of solving the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ChatGPT's brief explanation</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
            Both versions of the function work by first defining a helper function countdown that counts down from a given number n 
            by a given amount m until it reaches zero.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The <em>double-countdown</em> function then calls countdown twice, 
            once for each of the input numbers a and b, and appends the resulting lists together.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Finally, the function sorts the combined list in descending order and removes any duplicates using the <em>remove-duplicates</em> function.
